\abstract{
  Affective Computing has been considered as one of the essential aspects
  of massive human-computer interaction related projects. 
  This paper provides a broad introduction to recent advances in affective computing for emotion inference based on mobile techniques.
  We expand the emotion inference principles for different mobile commodity sensors, application context and their possible combinations in recent researches.
  Then we compare recent popular machine learning methods and models for these sensors,
  and highlight the most useful techniques and models for their performance.
  Our comparisons are not limited to traditional machine learning algorithm; they also include the representation learning models.
  In the end, we discuss few novel applications based on mobile affective computing techniques, such as how adaptive user interface and usability testing work in an emotion-aware system, as well as current limitations and open challenges of this research area.
