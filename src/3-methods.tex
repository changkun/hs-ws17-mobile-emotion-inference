\section{Methods \& Models}
\label{sec:models}

In this section, we present technical method and models in different data type aspects.

\subsection{Vision Aspect} 
\label{subsec:vision-model}

Landmark detection is the state of the art method and model based on convolutional neural network.
This is actually related to YOLO algorithm.

\subsection{Voice Aspect}
\label{subsec:voice-model}

Voice Aspect as we discussed in the previous section, emotion inferring from user speech is basically
processing user speech.

There is another method, which is inferring users' emotions for human-mobile voice dialogue applications.

\subsection{Touch Aspect}
\label{subsec:touch-model}

\begin{itemize}
  \item linear model: 
      \cite{Shah2015} hand crafted features, for three classes (happy, unhappy, neutral); 
      \cite{bhattacharya2017predictive} 7 proposed features, for four classes (Excited, Relaxed, Frustrated, Bored)

  \item feature engineer: \cite{Gao2012} application specific, application context
  \item 
\end{itemize}


\subsection{Other Aspect}
