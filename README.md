# HS WS17/18: Affective Computing

Affective Computing has been considered as one of the essential aspects
of massive human-computer interaction related projects. 
This paper provides a broad introduction to the recent advances in affective computing for emotion inferring based on mobile techniques.
We expand the emotion inferring principles for different mobile commodity sensors, application context and their possible combinations in the recent researches.
Then we compare the recent popular machine learning methods and models for these sensors,
and highlight the most useful techniques and models for their performance.
Our comparisons are not limited to traditional machine learning algorithm; they also include the representation learning models.
In the end, we discussed few novel applications based on mobile affective computing techniques, such as how adaptive user interface and usability testing works in an emotion-aware system, as well as current limitations and open challenges of this research area.
